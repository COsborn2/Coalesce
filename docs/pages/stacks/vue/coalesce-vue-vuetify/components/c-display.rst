.. MARKER:summary

A general-purpose component for displaying any :ref:`VueMetadataValue` by rendering the value to a string with the :ref:`display functions from the Models Layer <VueModelDisplayFunctions>`. For string and number :ref:`values <VueMetadataValue>`, usage of this component is largely superfluous. For all other value types including dates, booleans, enums, objects, and collections, it is very handy.
